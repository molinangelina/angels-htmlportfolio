            I am from Dallas, Texas. I currently live in Fort Worth. I'm 22 years old. 
            I recently made some big transitions in my life such as changing my nursing major 
            to computer science. Shortly after that I ended up dropping out so that I can be here. 
            I'm not getting any younger and I really wasn't trying to be in school for the next 4-5 
            years. Especially, when I have 96 credits for absolutely no reason now. I left TWU for a
            lot of reasons. Overall, the quality of education certainly did not match their tuition 
            rates. However, I've always been interested in computer science, but for whatever reason 
            I ignored my curiosity for a very long time. I basically took a lot of detours to get here. 
            I became interested in tech because of its job security and flexibility. I love the idea of 
            working remotely and being able to live wherever I want. Based on how things are going I really 
            don't want to live in the United States anymore. Also, it would be cool to be able to 
            travel and still work at the same time. I feel like there's a lot of freedom and I 
            want to experience that. I really like how coding allows you to see the fruits 
            of your labor. It's very rewarding to see your work come to fruition and that's some 
            thing that is very motivating to me. I value that tremendously.
